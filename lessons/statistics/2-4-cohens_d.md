[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

### Answer to Exercise 2.4

# Q 2.4: Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first ba- 
# bies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to 
# quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare 
# to the difference in pregnancy length?"
